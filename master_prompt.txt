TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

- Cards: scale 1.02 + shadow glow on hover.

CODE QUALITY STANDARDS:
- TypeScript strict mode.
- Explicit prop interfaces for components.
- Reusable UI primitives (Button, Card, CopyButton).

CONSTANTS FILE:
- Export SITE_CONFIG: name, tagline, description, links.

3) Add Button/Card/CopyButton primitives.
4) Wire constants and render content.
5) Implement copy-to-clipboard microinteraction.
6) Add Framer Motion animations and Intersection Observer triggers.
7) Make responsive and mobile-first.
8) Provide README with setup & deploy steps.

EXECUTION STEPS (Commands):
- npx create-next-app@latest fire-hq --typescript --tailwind --app
- cd fire-hq
- npm install framer-motion react-icons
- npx vercel (on successful build & test)

DELIVERY EXPECTATIONS:
- After scaffold, "npm run dev" should start without errors.
- All sections render and CTAs link to placeholders.

- Vercel preview URL generated for QA.

DO NOT:

2) Commit initial scaffold to git.
3) Push to GitHub and connect to Vercel for preview URLs.
