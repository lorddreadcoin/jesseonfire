Yo Jesse,

Got the site live for you to check out: https://jesseonfire.vercel.app

Fixed the purple belt thing and removed all the comedian positioning - it's all political/MMA truth-speaker now.

Also updated:
- PrizePicks promo to the correct "Play $5, Get $50" (was showing $100)
- Social links now point to @realjesseonfire
- Removed the confusing belt progression widget

Need 3 things from you when you get a sec:

1. Which 3-5 videos should be featured on the homepage? 
   (Send me titles or links)

2. Got a good photo we can use for the About section? 
   (Studio shot, training pic, whatever you think looks fire)

3. Any copy you want changed? 
   (The text on the site - I kept it simple but you know your voice better)

4. Are the Patreon tiers right? ($5 Spark, $15 Flame, $35 Inferno)
   (Let me know if prices or benefits need updating)

Take your time, I know you're busy. No rush.
