Yo Jesse,

Got the site live for you to check out: https://jesseonfire.vercel.app

Fixed the purple belt thing and removed all the comedian positioning - it's all political/MMA truth-speaker now.

Need 3 things from you when you get a sec:

1. Which 3-5 videos should be featured on the homepage? 
   (Send me titles or links)

2. Got a good photo we can use for the About section? 
   (Studio shot, training pic, whatever you think looks fire)

3. Any copy you want changed? 
   (The text on the site - I kept it simple but you know your voice better)

Also removed that belt progression thing that was confusing - kept it clean with just your subscriber count.

**IMPORTANT**: Need to verify your sponsor codes are correct:
- PrizePicks: JESSEONFIRE ($100 deposit match) - is this right?
- Magic Mind: JESSEFIRE20 (20% off) - correct code?
- YoKratom: FIRE15 (15% off) - your actual code?

If these aren't your exact affiliate codes, you won't get commission. Send me the right ones and I'll update immediately.

Take your time, I know you're busy. No rush.
