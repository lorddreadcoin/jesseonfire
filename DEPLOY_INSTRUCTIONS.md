## üì± Message for Jesse (Copy & Send):

```
Yo Jesse,

Got the site live for you to check out: [INSERT VERCEL URL HERE]

Fixed the purple belt thing and removed all the comedian positioning - it's all political/MMA truth-speaker now.

Need 3 things from you when you get a sec:

1. Which 3-5 videos should be featured on the homepage? 
   (Send me titles or links)

2. Got a good photo we can use for the About section? 
   (Studio shot, training pic, whatever you think looks fire)

3. Any copy you want changed? 
   (The text on the site - I kept it simple but you know your voice better)

Also removed that belt progression thing that was confusing - kept it clean with just your subscriber count.

Take your time, I know you're busy. No rush.
```

## ‚úÖ What's Working:
- Site is live and responsive
