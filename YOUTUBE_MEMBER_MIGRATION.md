# 🔥 YouTube Member → Discord Migration Strategy

## Executive Summary
Jesse's YouTube members ($4.99/mo) shouldn't have to double-pay on Patreon to get Discord access. BUILDAI has designed "Fire Bridge" - an automated verification system.

---

## 📊 The Problem
- YouTube Members pay $4.99/month
- Patreon Members pay $7.99-$14.99/month  
- YouTube members deserve Discord access without double payment
- Manual verification doesn't scale

---

## 🎯 The Solution: "Fire Bridge"

### Architecture
```
YouTube Member → Fire Bridge Portal → Discord Role
   ($4.99/mo)     (jesseonfire.com)    (Auto-assigned)
```

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Verification Portal
**Location:** jesseonfire.com/youtube-members

**Features:**
- Google/YouTube OAuth login
- Real-time membership verification
- Discord account linking
- Automatic role assignment
- Monthly re-verification

### Phase 2: Discord Bot ("FireGuard")
**Commands:**
- `!verify` - Start verification process
- `!status` - Check membership status
- `!link` - Link YouTube account
- `!help` - Get support

**Automation:**
- Auto-assign "YouTube Member" role
- Grant access to same channels as $7.99 Patreon tier
- Monthly membership check
- Welcome DM for verified members

### Phase 3: Security & Anti-Abuse
- One YouTube account = One Discord account
- IP tracking and rate limiting
- Screenshot verification as fallback
- Manual approval for edge cases
