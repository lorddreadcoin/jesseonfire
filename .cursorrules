# Jesse ON FIRE Website - Production Build Rules

## Context
High-stakes project for 516K subscriber YouTuber. Must be AAA+ quality.
User is donating this build for free - cannot fail.

## Code Standards
- TypeScript strict mode REQUIRED
- All components need explicit prop interfaces
- Use Tailwind classes only (no inline styles except dynamic transforms)
- Reusable components in components/ui/
- All copy from lib/constants.ts (NO hardcoded text)
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Critical Requirements
1. Copy-to-clipboard MUST work on mobile Safari (use fallback)
2. All external links: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
3. Guard window/document usage (useEffect or dynamic imports)
4. Next.js Image for all images
5. Framer Motion animations must be SSR-safe

## Component Structure
- Keep components focused and small
- Split into smaller files if >150 lines
- Export interfaces separately
- Group imports: React → Next → External → Internal

## Testing Before Commit
- npm run dev works
- No TypeScript errors
- No console errors
- Responsive on 375px, 768px, 1440px

## Deployment Blockers
- Any build errors = STOP and fix
- Missing dependencies = STOP and install
- Type errors = STOP and resolve

## Report After Each Phase
Output JSON summary with files created, tests run, errors, preview URL.
